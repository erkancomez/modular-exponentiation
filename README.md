# modular-exponentiation
The operation of modular exponentiation calculates the remainder when an integer b (the base) raised to the eth power (the exponent), be, is divided by a positive integer m (the modulus). In symbols, given base b, exponent e, and modulus m, the modular exponentiation c is: c = be mod m. From the definition of c, it follows that 0 â‰¤ c < m.
